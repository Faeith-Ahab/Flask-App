    <h2>The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text <br>
        (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout.<br>
        The phrase "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetuer" appears in Microsoft Word online Help. <br>
        This phrase has the appearance of an intelligent Latin idiom. <br>
        Actually, it is nonsense.</h2>
